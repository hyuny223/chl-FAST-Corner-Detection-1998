# chl-FAST-Corner-Detection-1998

# 1. Goal of Project
This project is for implement FAST Corner Detection algorithm based on Miroslav Trajkovii' paper.

# 2. How to Run
command below example.
```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -G Ninja ..
$ ninja
$ ./fast ../resoureces/${yourImage}
```

# 3. Limitations
## 1. Usage of OpenCV
I wanted to make algorithm without open sources. But it is hard from loading images.  
So, first of all, I made this with OpenCV in loading, preprocessing and accessing a image.  
Next goal is to make this algorithm run without open sources.

## 2. Diagonal Edges
In this paper, it is introduced how to deal with diagonal edges. Because it is very important to treat these edges for detecting corners.  
However, I haven't have idea to implement this into code yet.

In the picture above, not only corners, but also diagonal and even curves were detected.  
I would keep developing and upload code.  

## 3. Non-Maximamum-Suppression
To remove overlapping corners, this paper suggests to use NMS.  
However I haven't make this yet. 
I would keep developing it too.

## 4. Gaussian Blur
I implemented Gaussian Blur to remove texture corners like grass, leafs, bricks etc.  
However I made it so simple, then details of filters(like no sigma) are weak.
Neverthless, this greatly contributes to the improvement of performance.  

below is a result without blurring. Compare this and above result.
